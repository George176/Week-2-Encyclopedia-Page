    <p>How do plants feed themselves? How did dogs evolve from wolves? What good is the appendix in humans, anyway? Such
        questions fall within the domain of biology, which seeks to understand living organisms and their vital
        processes (although the jury’s still out on what our appendixes are for). Biology’s diverse fields include
        <span style="color: violet">botany, ecology, evolution, genetics, medicine, physiology, and zoology</span>.

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Marine biology, the science that deals with animals and plants that live in the sea. It also deals with
            airborne and terrestrial organisms that depend directly upon bodies of salt water for food and other
            necessities of life. In the broadest sense it attempts to describe all vital phenomena pertaining to the
            myriads of living things that dwell in the vast oceans of the world. Some of its specialized branches
            concern natural history, taxonomy, embryology, morphology, physiology, ecology, and geographical
            distribution. Marine biology is closely related to the science of oceanography because of the
            relationship of the physical features of the oceans to the living organisms that dwell in them. It aids
            in the understanding of marine geology through the study of those organisms that contribute their
            skeletal remains to the floors of the oceans or that elaborate the vast coral reefs of the tropic seas.

        <h3>Fast Facts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A principal aim of marine biology is to discover how ocean phenomena control the distribution of
                organisms.</li>
            <li>
                Marine biologists study the way in which particular organisms are adapted to the various chemical and
                physical properties of the seawater, to the movements and currents of the ocean, to the availability of
                light at various depths, and to the solid surfaces that make up the seafloor.
            </li>
            <li>
                Marine biology is also concerned with the effects of certain forms of pollution on the fish and plant
                life of the oceans, particularly the effects of pesticide and fertilizer runoff from land sources,
                accidental spills from oil tankers, and silting from coastline construction activities.

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Biological development, the progressive changes in size, shape, and function during the life of an
                organism
                by which its genetic potentials (genotype) are translated into functioning mature systems (phenotype).
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="The Scope of Development">
            <h3>The Scope of Development </h3>
            <p>In the entire realm of organisms, many different modes of development are found, the most important
                categories of which can be discussed as pairs of contrasting types. Development may amount to no
                more than a quantitative change (usually an increase) in a system that remains essentially
                unaltered. Qualitative development involves an alteration in the nature of the system. Pure examples
                of the first type are difficult to find. Approximations to it occur when an animal or plant has
                attained a structure with the full complement of organs; it then appears to increase only in size,
                that is to say, quantitatively.

    <div id="Taxonomy">
        <h2>Taxonomy</h2>
        <p>In biology, taxonomy (from Ancient Greek τάξις (taxis) 'arrangement', and -νομία (-nomia) 'method') is the
            scientific study of naming, defining (circumscribing) and classifying groups of biological organisms based
            on shared characteristics.
